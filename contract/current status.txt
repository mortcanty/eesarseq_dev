= Quick overview of the history and development of the CD methodology
   
   - 2003 the original bitemporal algorithm (DTU)  (Conradsen, Nielsen, Skriver, Schou, Skriver)
   
      - multilook full quad pol covariance matrices
      
      - complex Wishart distribution of observations => likelihood ratio (LR) hypothesis testing 
                                                           
      - verified with EMISAR aereal data

     - MatLab software available on Allan Nielsen‘s home page
                                                         
   - 2016 multitemporal algorithm
   
       - series of statistically independent LR tests to subsequences to determine times of change

       - (later) complete characterization of the block diagonal case (important for Sentinel-1)

       -  (later) application to satellite imagery (RadarSat-2 time series, comparison of Python and MatLab)

   - 2019  Loewner order definition for direction of change
   
   - after 2018 Series of papers (and tutorials) on applications with Google Earth Engine
   
       - nuclear site monitoring
   
       - Adaptive temporal filtering
       
       - Forest extent monitoring (in preparation) 
       
    - Software available: 
    
               MatLab (DTU website)
               
               Ordinary Python (GitHub repo accompanying my 2019 textbook)
               
               GEE Python API, Jupyter/Colab notebooks, Widget interface, Docker images (GitHub, DockerHub) 
               
               GEE JavaScript API (code editor)     
               
    -  Performance (GEE Python API version)
    
               full S1 swaths (approx 250x250 km²), ~ 20 images: ~ 1 hour as export task
               
               looking at single relative orbit tracks, e.g., North Sea to Switzerland, about 6 hours
